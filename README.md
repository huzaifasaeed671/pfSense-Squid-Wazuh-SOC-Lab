## 📖 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my SOC Internship at ITSimplera Solutions.

The objective was to build a complete security monitoring environment capable of:

- Filtering network traffic using pfSense Firewall
- Inspecting web traffic using Squid Proxy
- Detecting malware using SquidClamAV
- Forwarding firewall logs to Wazuh SIEM
- Creating custom Wazuh detection rules
- Monitoring security alerts from the Wazuh Dashboard
